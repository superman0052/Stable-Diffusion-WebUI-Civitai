## About Civitai Helper2: Model Info Helper
The first version of "Civitai Helper2" is already finished and I have used it for a while on my local machine. It works exactly as in the demo video I have released before(with some more functions).

But the developing process is extremely painful. Its maintenance will also be difficult. If I release it, with all those requests and issues from users, my life gonna be in hell.  

The reason for this is, gradio is not suitable for a professional level's management system. But under gradio's framework and SD webui's design, a lot of javascript things won't work well.  

So, it is too painful that I don't want to do any further maintenance and development on it. In the meantime, a lot of alternatives become popular. For example, ComfyUI and InvokeAI 3.x.

Especially InvokeAI 3.x, with its Unified Canvas and build-in node system, now we have a photoshop level's SD tool for free.  

If you are not familiar with InvokeAI 3.x, you can check this video:

And its unified canvas system:

So, for Model Info Helper, I'm re-designing it into a stand alone model and workflow management system, which should work with most popular SD UI, not just for SD webui.  

And I'll take down all workflow management functions so this stand alone version can be released sooner.   

Since it won't be released as estimated, I have updated the old civitai helper 1.x to work with latest SD webui.
